# VM
C Assembler and VM with 15 instructions and 16 registers (R0-R15):

To parse the input file (assumed input.txt), run ./parser < input.txt in the terminal. To run the output.txt with the VM, type ./VM < output.txt into the terminal. Note that he value stored in R0 is printed by default, so store the result of your final computation in that register.
